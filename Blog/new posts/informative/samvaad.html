     “Ikigai is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we all are searching for its meaning”<br>
     -Hector Garcia
     <br><br>
     
     "Ikigai" is a beautiful Japanese word that means reason for being. We grow up in a certain ambiance where each person involved in our life has different perspectives and goals. We often find ourselves caught in the web of the question "What about tomorrow?" In the hustle and the influence of the situation, we tend to forget our uniqueness, our reason for being and blindly follow the herd ahead.
     
     Ikigai is the discovery of one's lost inner voice.  If   happiness had   an   equation, it would be ikigai. We live in a bubble of hustle, when the pin of introspection bursts the bubble, that's when we discover our ikigai. The journey to find one begins right after answering the four questions: 1. What do I love? 2.What am I good at? 3. What can I be paid for? 4. What does the world need? Life is spontaneous, ikigai is the plan with several hints and clues to guide and help you dodge a bumpy ride. On knowing what our aim is and our strength and weaknesses are, we get an analysis of our life at that particular point and what we need to do to attain a stage of feeling satisfied. This is the guideline to have a happy, content and prosperous long life.
     
     We live in the world where winning is always celebrated, the aspect of not winning is never considered an option raising the anxiousness and hunger to attain the unachievable, often leading to dissatisfaction and depressive moments. Ikigai, the realization that there will be alternative paths to reach destination while enjoying the journey of living comes handy.
     
     Fr.C. Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Vashi truly believes in nurturing the students' intellectual and social skills by conducting events that stimulate the minds of the youth to raise their voices to emphasize their opinions and the ability to listen to every person in the room with their share of perspective.

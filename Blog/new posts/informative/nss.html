     The National Service Scheme (NSS) is an Indian Government- sponsored public service program conducted by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports of the Government of India.  The programme aims to instil the idea of social welfare in students, and to provide service to society without bias. NSS volunteers work to ensure that everyone who is needy gets help to enhance their standard of living and lead a life of dignity. In doing so, volunteers learn from people in villages how to lead a good life despite a scarcity of resources. 
     The NSS unit of FCRIT, Vashi was started in the year 2019 in the month of September. This unit functions under the guidance of Program officers, Mr. Rahul Jadhav, computer department and Mrs.Dhanashree Hadsul, I.T. department. The unit has 50 volunteers from the degree college.

     Blood Donation Camp
     <br><br>
     “It is said that when people give, people live… A single pint of blood can save three lives, and a single gesture can create a million smiles!”
      <br><br>
     The NSS unit of FCRIT along with Agnel’s Social Cell organised a Blood Donation Camp on 16th January 2020, in collaboration with Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), Vashi. The event was conducted in Diploma Seminar Hall of Agnel’s Polytechnic between 9 am to 2 pm ,on the first day of Etamax, the three day technical fest of FCRIT.
     The camp was available to all and any member of the institute who met the safety criteria was allowed to donate blood. A registration desk was set up in the entrance of the hall with NSS volunteers serving as receptionists, who guided the donators with the process of registration. Further, once the necessary paperwork was completed, the individual was tested for their blood pressure and blood group by the professionals from NMMC Hospital.
     An amount of 350ml of blood was donated by each donor and the process of blood collection was done in a very hygienic and precise manner. The syringes once used, were disposed off and the blood bags were arranged properly according to their blood type.
     A total of 111 individuals, staff and students included, participated in the blood donation camp and each volunteer was awarded a donor card as an appreciation of their goodwill. Moreover, to help with the dizziness that comes after donating blood, each volunteer was provided with liquid and solid refreshments.
     At each stage of the event, volunteers of NSS and social cell were always present to help the event flow in ease. The blood donation camp was considered a huge success, as in its first instalment, it attracted about 111 donors, many of them from rarer blood groups. The teams who organised this event wait eagerly to lend their efforts to another such success.

     NSS CAMP
     <br><br>
     “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.” 
     The NSS unit of FCRIT organised a camp for its members from January 4th to 10th 2020. It was based in the rural areas of Ambele Bk., Shivale, Murbad, Thane and was attended by twenty of their student volunteers and program officers. The camp was aimed at aiding the general mission of the NSS and engaged the students in numerous social activities during its course. On day 1, the students arrived at the location, had an introduction chain, and were segregated into three groups for the distribution of work. The students were acquainted with the importance of team building and forming a comfort zone with their co-workers and all the three groups were given the exciting task of deciding on a group name and slogan that truly represented them. The highlight of day 2 was a disaster management seminar that started with general knowledge on what to do when there is a medical emergency.  The students were briefed with the EMS (Emergency Medical Services) which include fire brigade, ambulance and police and the calling procedure was explained. Further into the seminar, the process of CPR was taught. All volunteers practised it individually. A demo was given by the guests and eventually two volunteers were encouraged to come forward and perform it. The next part covered mobility, and the students were introduced to various lifts and during which situations each type was to be used. Bandaging in the case of fractures, eye injury and head injury was first aid for snake bites and nose bleeding were discussed and shown. The seminar concluded by providing general information and bursting the myths regarding Epilepsy. There was also an inauguration ceremony held in the evening, that included the participants and eminent village personalities. General information and motives of the NSS was shared and the youth were encouraged and promised full cooperation of the villagers in all of the activities. On day 3, a survey under Unnat Bharat Abhiyan was carried out by the students. The students went from house to house to fill out a hard and soft copy of the survey form. At the completion of the survey, problems regarding waste water disposal and road construction were found in many forms. The students were taken on a trek in the second half of the day. It was witnessed during the trek what the village had in store for a nature lover. With picturesque landscapes and farms, it was definitely a visual treat for everyone. After the trek, the participants attended a Bhajan-keertan session at the village sarpanch’s house. It was followed by a campfire that set a platform for sharing volunteers’ experience so far and provided a refreshing and relaxing evening to all after the intensive trek.
     On day 4, the volunteers attended the morning assembly of Ambele’s school, and students' passion for learning and education was reflected well through the assembly. Some of the students were very talented and had participated at various district-level competitions. Some of the volunteers were assigned the teaching task whereas others were sent to do the surveys. The volunteers had made groups of two or three for each classroom and had started teaching by interacting with the children. The kids there were taught to have basic conversation in English and poems were read, recited and explained. The volunteers learned the patience to make the other understand. A “Women Empowerment through Health” seminar was conducted in the school hall by Dr. Bharti Bote from Shivale. The NSS volunteers had invited all the women of the village by going house to house. Through a question answer session, the lecturer pointed out that most women ignore their own health and hunger to feed the others. She advised all the women to eat when everyone is and advertised about the anaemia pills that were offered for free at the government hospitals (under Anaemia Mukt Bharat), as a survey by WHO found that most Indian women suffer from Anaemia(90%). By sharing her own experiences, she explained about the health hazards of using a ragged cloth for menstruation and highlighted the necessity of using sanitary napkins instead. The interactive session ended by a discussion on the available birth control methods and children’s health programs. Day 5 had another teaching session where the volunteers continued with some technological introduction. They were then taken to Ambele’s ‘bandhara (dam). The canal there required repair (was leaking water), and the students were more than ready to lend a helping hand. Meanwhile, some volunteers cleaned the edges of the river and cleared the litter floating on the river.Later, a seminar was conducted by Mr. Pandurang Bhoir and Warghade sir on “Building science projects using waste materials”. In this seminar a lot of physics was taught to the school students. On day 6, Kalamkhande, a village neighbouring to Ambele, was visited for a survey. The very first activity there was to interact with the school children (from 1st to 4th standard). They were taught some poems, their doubts in English lessons were cleared, some hindi poems were recited and basics about computers were taught. A ‘bandhara’ was also needed to be built in Kalamkhande to retain water during monsoon. The volunteers were taken to the locations and instructed on how to dig efficiently and till what amount the sacks needed to be filled. Ropes were cut into pieces to tie around the sack in order for the soil to not escape. The sacks were carried down the 6-feet dam by them and laid on only one wall as the other two were impossible to route to.
     <br><br>
     So summing up, the students had the great satisfaction of creating awareness, helping the rural society and learning about their way of life. The camp also ensured that there was time each day for morning exercises for their volunteers to remain active and energised during the day and conducted fun games occasionally to break the ice . The students shall always treasure and cherish these wonderful memories created here by them.
